# Image Inpainting for Anime Digital Painting (Underdevelopment)

This project is free time project inspire by anime related project and DeepCreampy. Model is pytorch implementation of [zoom-to-inpaint](https://github.com/google/zoom-to-inpaint).

## Disclaimer

Since this model have around 4.5 million parameters and may require a lot of images (10k-100k images), cost of training is very high for author. Author decided to abandon training step and afterward. If anyone like to use this model, please use at your own risk.

## Requirements

### Cuda GPU and Cuda Software

This project is coded to train with Cuda, so Cuda GPU and [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) is required. [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) is optional but can be installed to train the model faster.

### Python Environments
